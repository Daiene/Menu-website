A website that gives you snack options in the form of a menu.
See ingredients and prices, add special ingredients and/or leave a note in your order, decide if you want to buy just the snack or the snack with fries.

## About
The menu-website was born with the aim of giving me challenges to explore the JavaScript language, to get to know its features better, giving me the opportunity to learn and develop with it.
I challenged myself a lot and it wasn't easy, but it was done.

My challenge on this project with JavaScript included:
- Make a snack option appear at a time, when clicking on its respective button.
- Build a carousel for each tab.
- Pop up a popup for special customer remarks when pressing each purchase button across all tabs and carousel.
- Have a different background for each selected item.
- And the most challenging of all, which took me a lot of time, was doing the calculator part, because when the user enters the amount of additional items he wants, the final value of the snack needs to be changed. 

Also, I worked with Media Query to make the project responsive and the site also be used by cell phones.
